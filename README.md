# ðŸŒŸ Mini CV â€“ HTML, CSS & JavaScript

This is a simple one-page static website that displays my mini CV. After learning CSS, I styled the HTML to give the page a bit of personality while keeping the layout clean and minimal.

After learning JavaScript, I added a simple script that makes different sections of the CV zoom in when hovered over with the mouse. This adds a subtle interactive touch to the page and makes it more engaging.
